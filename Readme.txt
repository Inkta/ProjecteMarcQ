Execute install.sh
this will install all the dependecies needed for node and all the components inside the application.
You will also need a config.js file with the information about mongodatabase (user, pass, collection, etc..), paste this file inside MoneyHunter folder.
Once you have all the files inside just run node server.js in terminal and you're good to go. :)
